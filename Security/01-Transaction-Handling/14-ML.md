# 1. What is Machine Learning? (ML)
ML is fundamentally just a science, in which, developers focus on teaching machines or computers to perform certain tasks without being given specific information. I mean, we want our machines to learn how to do something themselves without us having to explain it to them. Before doing this, looking at how human brain works and then design virtual brains that work in a similar manner can be a great example. Now you might think that ML and AI is the same since they can do stuff without guiding, but no, they're not. AI is a broad field and every system that can learn and solve problems can be considered as an AI, but ML is one specific approach. in ML the AI doesn't recieve any instructions. It isn't static and it doesn't follow clear and strict steps to solve problems. It's dynamic.

In ML we have different approaches, two main approaches are *supervised learning* and *unsupervised learning*.
## Supervised Learning
Let's take a model, a set of inputs and also the corresponding outputs,  which are desired results. In this way the model learns to match certain inputs to certain outputs and it adjusts its structure. It learns to make connections between what was put in and what the desired output is. When well trained enough, we can use the model to make predictions for inputs that we don't know the results are for.
## Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, we don't give our model the desired results while training, not because we don't want to but because we don't know them. This approach is more like a kind of pattern recognition. We give the model a set of input data and it then has to look for patterns in it. Once trained, we can put new data and our model will need to make decisions. Since it doesn't get information it has to work with similar patterns in the data.
## Reinforcement Learning
There's a third type of ML along with a 4oth one. Here, some model with a random structure is creared, then we observe what it does and encourage it, when we like what it does. Otherwise we can also give negative feedback. The more our model does what we want it to do, the more we reinforce it and the more encouragment it gets. In this way our model can learn what is right and what is wrong. You can imagine it a little bit like natural selection and survival of the fittest.
## Deep Learning
Deep learning is just one area of machine learning, namely the one which works with natural networks. Neural networks are a very comprehensive and a complex topic.
## Why Python?
Python is widely used for ML, since it provides a lot of frameworks and tools then any other languages. There are other languages like R (rust), MATLAB and LISP but overrall, python is recommended.

# 2. Setting Up - Modules
## NumPy
NumPy module allows us to work with vectors, matrices and multi-dimensional arrays, it is crucial for linear algebra and numerical analysis.
## Matplotlib
This library is responsible for plotting graphs and visualizing data, offering numerous types of plotting, styles and graphs.
## Pandas
Pandas offers a powerful data structure. This library allows us to efficiently work with our huge amounts of interrelated data. We can merge, reshape, filter and query our data. 
## scikit-learn
This library is porbably the most important Python library for traditional ML, it features classification, regression and clustering algorithms. It also wllows us to work with support vector machines.
## Tensorflow
This is one of the most popular ML frameworks, out there developed by Google. It's a whole ecosystem for developing modern deep learning models. This means that it is mainly used for the development and training of models.
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
```
# 3. Linear Regression
One of the most basic and easiest ML algorithm is linear regression. It will be the first one that we are going to look at and it is a supervised learning algorithmm meaning we need both inputs and outputs to train a model.
![Mathematical Linear Regression Example](./images/linear-math.png)
In the figure above, there are a lot of different points, which all have an `x-value` and `y-value`. The `x-value` is called the feature, whereas the `y-value` is the label. The label is the result for our feature. Our *linear rehression model* is represented by the blue line that goes straight through our data. It is placed so that it is as close as possible to all points at the same time, so we "trained" the line to fit the existing points or the existing data.
The idea is now to take a new x-value without knowing the corresponding y-value. We then look at the line and find the resulting y-value there, which the model predicts for us. Since this line is quite generalized, we will relatively inaccurate result.
## Loading Data
Before getting started, we need data we will work with (Dataset from UCI)
[UCI Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test+split
```
