# E2EE (End-to-End Encryption)
E2EE makes sure that data is encrypted on the sender's side and only decrypted on the reciever's side, meaning no intermediaries can access the data. Each user has a public and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and private one, for decryption. The private key should never be shared. Occasion where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, is called **Symmetric Encryption**, it's typically used to encrypt the content once it's already secured with assymetric encryption.
## In Node
To implement E2EE in Node.js app, you must install dependencies, such as `crypto` and `jsonwebtoken`, along with `RSA keys`.
```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -aes256
openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
```
When entering this line, it will ask you to enter some fields. There you should enter secured password which is then encrypted and saved in `private.pem` file which is generated along with `public.pem`. When entering the fields, you might notice that the characters you type in won't show, this is for security reasons, just type in a password you would like to use and click enter two times (for validation).

Handle enctption and decryption:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('public.pem', 'utf8');
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('private.pem', 'utf8');
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/encrypt', (req, res) => {
    const {message} = req.body;

    if(!message) {
        return res.status(400).send('Message Required');
    }

    const encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, Buffer.from(message));
    res.json({ encrypted: encrypted.toString('base64')});
});

app.post('/decrypt', (req, res) => {
    const {encrypted} = req.body;

    if(!encrypted) {return res.status(400).send('Encrypted msg is required')};

    const decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(privateKey, Buffer.from(encrypted));
    res.json({decrypted: decrypted.toString('utf8')});
})

const options = {
    key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('cert.pem');
};

https.createServer(options, app).listen(3000);
```
### Client Side (E2EE)
```js
function encryptData(msg) {
    const publicKey = 'from the server'
    const buffer = new TextEncoder().encode(msg);

    return window.crypto.subtle.encrypt(
        {
            name: "RSA-OAEP",
        },
        publicKey,
        buffer
    );
};
```
```js
async function sendEncrypted(encMsg) {
    const response = await fetch('https://localhost:3000/encrypt', {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({msg: encMsg}),
        headers: {"Content-Type":"application/json"},
    });
    const data = await reponse.json();
};
// fetch() - fetch api to make HTTP request
```
**TextEncoder().encode(message)** = Convert Message into a `Uint8Array` which is a binary format that the encryption function can understand.
**window.crypto.subtle.encrypt** = This part of the Web Crypto API allows you tp perform cryptographic operations like encryption.
**RSA-OAEP** = Algorithm used for encryption, which is based on RSA encryption with OAEP. Here public key is required.
**res.json({ decrypted: decrypted.toString('utf8') });** = Converting decrypted message from binary format to readable string in UTF-8 encoding.

**Buffer** = built-in object used to handle binary data. An array of bytes.
**Base64** = Encoding method, transforms binary data into an ASCII string. Best way to represent binary data in a format that can be printedm like JSON.
