# Green Pay
Introduce you to Green Pay! This might be the biggest project that I am planning to start yet, which has a lot of critical requirements to deploy, which will alone take about a year to learn and 1+ years to create assets, analyse, test and improve. Basically Green Pay is a comprehensive payment system, that will be built from zero to hero. This project will include from mastering basics steps of MERN stack to advanced security and payment methods & validation.
